Version: 0.0.8
Date: 22. 06. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Added new major feature: Stack Size Manager! This feature allows for global modification of item stack sizes to better suit your playstyle.
    - The feature is fully configurable in the startup settings and offers two distinct modes:
      1. Multiplier Mode: Multiplies the original stack size of all items by a specified number (e.g., 2.0 for double stacks). This maintains the relative difference between items.
      2. Absolute Value Mode: Sets a single, uniform stack size for all applicable items in the game.
    - The new system covers all relevant item types, including tools, ammo, modules, vehicles, and other special items, ensuring comprehensive and consistent changes.
    - The core logic has been meticulously tested to ensure maximum compatibility and stability.

Version: 0.0.7
Date: 21. 06. 2025
  Changes:
    - Completed a full code refactoring for the "Even Distribution" feature. The logic has been split from a single monolithic file into several specialized modules (constants, utils, distribution, control).
    - This change does not affect the feature's functionality from the player's perspective, but it significantly improves code readability, stability, and maintainability, preparing the mod for future enhancements.

  Changes:

Date: 20. 06. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed a critical issue where the manual crafting speed modifier was not reapplied after loading a saved game.
  Changes:
    - Complete internal code refactoring. The mod is now fully modular, with each feature separated into its own files. This will improve stability and make adding new features much easier.
    - All mod setting names have been renamed to be more descriptive and prevent potential conflicts with other mods (e.g., "exteros-cs-enabled" is now "crafting-speed-enabled").
